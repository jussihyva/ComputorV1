The mathematical term polynomial is not in my backbone. That's the reason why I decided to get a basic understanding of what it is and how to solve two-degree polynomials.

I decided to read and watch these three topics:

* [Quadratic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation)
* [Factoring Quadratics... How? (NancyPi)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=YtN9_tCaRQc&feature=youtu.be)
* [Solving Polynomial Equations - MathHelp.com - Algebra Help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=g7_llQnLepA&feature=youtu.be)
